a racing game

A responsive racing game that allows the user to choose a vehicle for the race and displays the winner using HTML, SCSS and Javascript.

This project is setup on Visual Studio Code and hosted on firebase. The aim of the project is to demonstrate my ability to manipulate the DOM using javascript.

Vanilla javascript is used for the majority of the application to display different menus and allow users to select a vehicle. It is also used to move the vehicles at a 
random pace and to determine which vehicle reached the finished line first. Custom Html and Css is used to showcase my knowledge of the technologies without requiring 
any library. Sass is used for features such as mixin's and nesting to allow for a smoother workflow and helps to keep things organized while also allowing me to create 
stylesheets faster. Media queries are used to ensure the websites responsiveness.
